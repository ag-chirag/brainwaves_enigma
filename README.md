QLess

Developed by Team Enigma

QLess is an application developed to make the current system of tokens used to 
maintain physical queues inside banks redundant.

By providing real time data related to "customer traffic" congestion inside banks, 
customers can decide as to when would it be best for them to visit the bank, based on
estimates provided by the application.

This way we aim to improve customer time utilization inside the bank so as to get his/her 
work done faster thereby enriching his experience and improving customer experience.

Technologies Used:

Php-MySQL used to build the server.

Android used to provide the mobile interface for the customer to use.
